Stumbled accross the source when looking through my hard drive. I fixed and added some features that I believe is essential for legit cheats and legit cheating. The offsets and some features are very likely outdated. Added features:
- Better config system (will ask to confirm when you want to load/save/delete a config in game)
- Mouse delta fix for faceit serverside
- Thirdperson when dead
- Max aim inaccuracy for triggerbot
- Max shot inaccuracy for triggerbot
- No zoom 
- Team damage counter 
- Visuals (ESP , glow, chams) can be binded to a custom key 
- Hit marker damage indicator
